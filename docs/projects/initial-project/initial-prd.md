# Bilan Content Creation Demo - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

A demonstration application that showcases how to integrate Bilan SDK into an AI-powered content creation assistant. The app enables users to create, iterate, and refine written content while sending comprehensive behavioral analytics to Bilan's server. This is a CLIENT application - it generates analytics data for Bilan to process and display, it does not show analytics itself.

## Target Users

**Primary**: Developers evaluating Bilan for their AI products
**Secondary**: Product managers and founders building AI-powered applications

## Core User Journey

### Entry Experience
Users arrive at a clean, professional content creation interface with three prominent content type options:
- **Blog Post Writer**: For article creation and technical writing
- **Email Assistant**: For professional correspondence 
- **Social Media Creator**: For posts and marketing content

### Content Creation Flow

#### 1. Project Initiation
- User selects content type and provides initial brief
- Simple text input: "Write a blog post about AI development best practices for startups"
- Optional context fields: target audience, desired tone, content length
- Single "Generate Content" button starts the creative process

#### 2. AI Content Generation
- Loading state with progress indicator
- Generated content appears in clean, readable format
- Content is presented with clear typography and proper spacing
- Each piece of generated content is treated as a distinct "turn"

#### 3. User Response Interface
For each piece of generated content, users see:
- **Accept Options**: 
  - "Use This" (content meets needs as-is)
  - "Good Starting Point" (will edit/build upon it)
- **Iteration Options**:
  - "Try Different Approach" (generate alternative)
  - "Refine This" (make specific improvements)
- **Specific Feedback**:
  - Quick buttons: "Too Formal", "Too Casual", "Off Topic", "Too Generic"
  - Text input for detailed feedback: "Make it more conversational for developers"

#### 4. Iterative Refinement
- Users can request multiple rounds of changes
- Each iteration builds on previous attempts and feedback
- Clear visual indication of iteration number ("Attempt 3 of this section")
- Users can "go back" to previous versions if preferred
- Option to start completely fresh at any point

#### 5. Content Completion
- Users indicate when they're satisfied with content
- Options for final disposition:
  - "Perfect as-is" 
  - "Good foundation, will edit"
  - "Useful inspiration, will rewrite"
  - "Not what I needed" (abandonment)

### Analytics Integration

#### Behind-the-Scenes Tracking
The app silently sends comprehensive analytics data to Bilan:
- Content generation events with full context
- User feedback and satisfaction signals
- Refinement patterns and iteration data
- Session completion and abandonment tracking

#### Bilan Dashboard Access
- Prominent "View Analytics Dashboard" button opens Bilan in new tab
- Users can see their interaction data in Bilan's analytics interface
- Clear separation between content creation (this app) and analytics viewing (Bilan dashboard)

**Important Note**: This demo app focuses on content creation while sending analytics data to Bilan. All analytics visualization happens in the separate Bilan dashboard - this keeps the user experience clean and demonstrates proper separation of concerns.

## Interface Design Principles

### Content Creation Area
- **Primary Focus**: Large, central content display area
- **Clean Typography**: Readable fonts, proper spacing, clear hierarchy
- **Visual Content Separation**: Each generated piece clearly delineated
- **Progress Indication**: Clear sense of iteration count and session progress

### Feedback Interface
- **Non-Intrusive**: Feedback options available but not overwhelming
- **Quick Actions**: Common feedback (tone, style) accessible with single clicks
- **Detailed Input**: Option for specific written feedback when needed
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication when feedback has been submitted

### Navigation and Layout
- **Single Page Experience**: No complex navigation required
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and tablet
- **Persistent Session**: User can leave and return to continue working
- **Clear Exit Points**: Easy to start over or try different content type

## User Interaction Models

### Content Type Selection
Users choose from three well-defined content types, each with:
- **Clear Use Case Description**: "Create engaging blog posts and articles"
- **Example Prompts**: "Write about startup fundraising tips"
- **Expected Outcomes**: "Blog post draft ready for editing"

### Feedback Mechanisms

#### Explicit Feedback
- **Thumbs Up/Down**: Binary satisfaction rating
- **Refinement Requests**: Specific improvement directions
- **Acceptance Levels**: How user plans to use the content

#### Implicit Feedback Signals
- **Iteration Patterns**: How many attempts before satisfaction
- **Timing Data**: How quickly user responds to generated content
- **Abandonment Points**: Where users give up in the process
- **Return Behavior**: Whether users come back for more content

### Content Refinement Workflow
- **Incremental Improvement**: Each iteration builds on previous work
- **Flexible Direction**: Users can request tone, structure, or content changes
- **Comparison Options**: Side-by-side view of different attempts
- **Version Control**: Easy navigation between different versions

## Success Metrics (What Bilan Tracks)

### Content Creation Effectiveness
- **Iteration Efficiency**: Average attempts needed for acceptable content
- **Acceptance Patterns**: Which content types work best for which users
- **Refinement Success**: Whether specific feedback leads to better outcomes
- **Content Utilization**: How users actually use generated content

### User Satisfaction Indicators
- **Completion Rates**: Percentage of sessions ending with usable content
- **Return Usage**: Users coming back for additional content creation
- **Feedback Sentiment**: Positive vs negative feedback patterns
- **Session Duration**: Time invested before achieving satisfaction

### Behavioral Pattern Recognition
- **User Preferences**: Learning individual taste and style preferences
- **Content Quality Signals**: What characteristics make content valuable
- **Frustration Detection**: Identifying when users struggle with AI output
- **Value Discovery**: Patterns that lead to user "aha moments"

## Content Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Blog Post Creation
**User Goal**: Write technical blog post for developer audience
**Expected Flow**: 
- Initial draft too formal → request casual tone → accept refined version
- Demonstrates tone preference learning and iteration patterns

### Scenario 2: Email Writing
**User Goal**: Professional but friendly email to potential customer
**Expected Flow**:
- First attempt too sales-y → request softer approach → still too casual → find middle ground
- Shows goldilocks effect and user taste calibration

### Scenario 3: Social Media Content
**User Goal**: Engaging LinkedIn post about product launch
**Expected Flow**:
- Generate multiple variations → cherry-pick elements from different attempts → combine into final version
- Demonstrates creative exploration vs refinement patterns

## Key User Value Propositions

### For Content Creators
- **Faster First Drafts**: AI provides good starting points for further development
- **Tone Calibration**: Learn to communicate desired style to AI effectively
- **Creative Inspiration**: Explore ideas and approaches they might not consider

### For Developers Evaluating Bilan

**Analytics Viewing**: All behavioral insights and patterns are viewed in the Bilan dashboard, not in this demo app

## Interface States

### Loading States
- **Content Generation**: Progress indicator with estimated time
- **Refinement Processing**: Clear indication that feedback is being incorporated
- **Background Analytics**: Subtle indication that events are being tracked

### Error States
- **Generation Failure**: Clear message with retry options

This PRD focuses entirely on the content creation user experience while ensuring the application sends rich behavioral data to Bilan's analytics server. The demo app is a CLIENT of Bilan - it generates and transmits analytics events but does NOT display analytics. All analytics visualization happens in the separate Bilan dashboard, maintaining proper separation of concerns and demonstrating best practices for Bilan SDK integration.
